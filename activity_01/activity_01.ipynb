Given the information of the frequent singletons $(L_1)$ and frequent pairs $(L_2)$ we compute with our previous implementation of A-Priori for k=2, implement in spark functions to compute the  **confidence** and **interest** of all the binary rules we can build from the set $L_2$. As the dataset to test your code, **compute** a set of transactions from this data set:\n",

    "2. Map each association rule of the previous resulting RDD, to a triple with (rule,confidence,interest). Observe that you will need to use the information in L1 and the number of transactions to compute these values. You can use the version of L1 stored as a python list in the driver program (so it can be passed inside functions passed to spark tasks).\n",
